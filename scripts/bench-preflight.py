"""Refuse to benchmark on a host too busy for the numbers to mean anything.

    scripts/bench-preflight.py            # gate: exits non-zero when contaminated
    scripts/bench-preflight.py --report   # always exits 0, prints the verdict

This exists because of 2026-08-01, when a degraded host produced 77 internally
consistent measurements that were 4.6x-20.9x wrong in absolute terms. Tight
confidence intervals did not save that run: every arm was slow together, so
nothing inside the data looked wrong. The only defence is refusing to measure in
the first place, which is what this does.

Noise widens confidence intervals, so a contaminated run is more likely to report
"not significant" than a false "faster". A verdict of NOT-faster from a busy host
is therefore inconclusive rather than evidence -- which matters when the decision
on the table is whether to delete an engine.
